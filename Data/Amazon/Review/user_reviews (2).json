{"rating":5,"title":"Abbott and Costello universal collection","text":"This was probably my favorite prime day purchase and was a fantastic deal.  My daughter (39 years) is so excited to watch these and share with my grandsons these movies of her childhood.  They were old then, old when I watched me as a child too!  But funny is funny.  It's an era of comedy that has passed and is being rediscovered and appreciated again.  We gave up buying DVD's a long time ago and just stream purchases any more - but this set was worthy of the purchase.  Whole Family friendly and worth the price when not on sale!","parent_asin":"B00IJUIY3S","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":0,"category":"Movies_TV","product_title":"Abbott & Costello: Universal Pictures Collection"}

{"rating":5,"title":"Die Hard","text":"My husband considers this a christmas movie.  Eh... not me so much.  But it is action packed and a great young bruce willis project.  Foreign terrorists take over a building.  Wife is very successful - marriage on the rock with bruce willis - he wants to reconcile.. she is less convinced - until he shows his hero badge.  It's a fun action packed movie.  No nudity or sex, but lots of language - in case you're considering ages.

{"rating":5,"title":"Bobs Red Mill Organic brown rice farina","text":"Bobs red mill organic brown rice farina.  One of my favorite cereals.  I prefer Bobs Red Mill brand the best. In my opinion is tastes better than cream of wheat - creamier in texture and of course tastes different than wheat because it's rice.  Easy on an upset stomach.  And delicious when you want a creamier cereal than wheat or oats. I like it sweet or savory - a little butter and cinnamon and sugar or a poached egg on top with a little salt and pepper.

They are deeply chewy (NOT for questionable mouth gear) and little - how would say, not really salt, but peanutty - just a little with the peanuts.  Mostly it's about that chewy nougat.  MMMMMmmm  I've always loved them.  Freeze and break into pieces, or break at room temp.  For whatever reason I can't get them locally, so I have to order.  Really happy with these - you get 6 full size bars.  A big spendy, but worth it to me.  They are  \ud63bHaving said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.
