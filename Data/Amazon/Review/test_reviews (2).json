{"rating":5,"title":"Worth the conversation","text":"Wow.  There are a lot of really intense reviews about this movie.  Please remember that we all have the right to have an opinion and I am not trying to make any one change their minds or believe the way I do.<br \/>First, the movie is very one sided.  Having said that, it is important to see what is happening and even the one sided approach can spark conversations that will lead to much needed changes.<br \/>Second, Sea World had an opportunity to comment.  They declined.  That speaks volumes to me and leads me to believe they may have been less than honest. I would have liked to have heard their &#34;side.&#34;<br \/>That being said, you cannot completely discount the accounts of the persons who were actually involved with these particular animals.<br \/>I believe it is a sincere and horrible tragedy that these animals have been captured at all, ever.<br \/>I think this movie is worth a viewing and a conversation.  I gave it 5 stars for the POSSIBILITY that it could have a positive impact on how we see this magnficent animals.  Orcas, also known as &#34;killer whales&#34; are actually dolphins.  And to date, there has never been a recorded &#34;attack&#34; on humans in the wild.  I think this important to note. In fact, the just the opposite as with smaller species of dolphins. And they have unique &#34;personalities&#34;... not unlike humans. I am fortunate enough to live in Oregon and not far from where we hosted Keiko (Free Willy) for some time as they attempted to &#34;rehabilitate&#34; Keiko enough to release him.  Sadly, that ended tragically. And in Keiko's case, I wish they had never released him.  Clearly he was very deeply imprinted on humans and sought out gentle contact with them even after his release. I believe that while Tilikum and Keiko were both orcas, they are were clearly different in temperament. I don't think you can discount temperament either.  Sadly Tilikum has proven that he has the capcity to harm and the willingness to do so. Further,  I was shocked to hear that the &#34;trainers&#34; at Sea World are NOT trained or educated at all.  You can walk off the street and apply to be a &#34;trainer.&#34;  If you can swim, have an appealing personality and physical appearance, you're in.  No real education, no real training, not even a high school diploma.  Disappointing.  However, to me that puts more of the burden of responsibility squarely on Sea World for the safety of their &#34;trainers.&#34;<br \/>I hope that if you chose to watch this movie that you do so with an open mind and heart.  It's NOT a perfect movie.

{"rating":5,"title":"Iconic Caffe Latte","text":"I am having some major surgery coming up.  My doctor recommended a different drink (3 a day for 5 days before surgery - and 3 a day for 2 weeks after). Only problem is the protein drink he recommended was HORRIBLE.  The 5th ingredient is anchovy paste!!  It was truly awful and a hundred bucks for 12 drinks!  So, I asked if I could sub out the awful, super expensive drink for these Iconic drinks.  He agreed!  I ordered the Iconic chocolate truffle, the caffe latte and the vanilla.  Do you like chocolate milk?! Who doesn't, the chocolate truffle tastes like the best chocolate milk you've ever tried!  When I drink the caffe latte I pour it over ice or blend with ice and it's like a really terrific iced coffee!  The vanilla bean is as delicious as it sounds. And they all SMELL good too. Honestly.  All of this, without anything that is bad for you and 20 grams of protein!!  In fact my doctor says he will now recommend these drinks.  When you HAVE to do a meal replacement drink - you have GOT to try these first!  I am soooo grateful for them - for taste and cost!  Plus they are shelf stable!!!  So refrigerate as you need them!  I would give these 10 stars if I could.  Just ordered  more. I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

This review is about the avocado oil and sea salt version. IN MY OPINION the avocado version tastes the most like actual tasty popcorn.  The cheezy has a little bit of a grainy aftertaste that wasn't my favorite. The coconut oil version is very, very faintly sweet  - MAYBE a teeny tiny tad of coconut?  It's ok. Now, for ALL three the thing to note is how super tiny the kernels are!  So tiny.  It's a little hard to eat because it is so tiny.  I am thinking about getting a spoon to eat it.  It's hard to \"pinch\" like you do with popcorn because they are so tiny!  1\/2 cup is a serving... All the flavors have the same calories in that 1\/2 cup - 60.  Honestly, it will be hard to eat just 1\/2 a cup... but we'll see.  There are three ingredients... organic sorghum... avocado oil... and sea salt. Gotta love something processed with only 3 ingredients.  The use by date on my bag - 02-22-22.  Sheesh.  It won't last a week here!  And that's without artificial preservatives.

When it crystallizes, spread in on toast or heat to re-liquefy.  Without bees AND beekeepers, there would be little to NO food for us to eat.  It has many medicinal properties... some you might be really suprised by... Be careful, never try to treat yourself - always check with a doctor first. Anyway... support your local beekeeper. It is NOT easy to keep bees. It takes real knowledge and skill.  Buy local when you can and buy often.  Now... having said all this... I received my honeycomb quickly (I have prime) and it arrived in perfect condition along with other items I had ordered.  I have included some pics for you to see. The plastic box was closed and there was NO honey leakage.  I was hoping for an slight orange blossom type flavor... but perhaps that is not in season? It IS slightly floral... the comb is tender and the caps are full and delicious.  I am just not sure the flavor is my favorite.  Everyone likes something different and I encourage you to try this particular seller.  I did order some other from a different area and seller and the comb was not fresh... tasting like plastic.

I love PB2 because it does contain less fat and calories... it tastes good...and it is so versatile.  It is a powder... you add a tiny bit of water and voile! Peanut butter.  You can make a tablespoon full or a more... 1\/2 cup.. etc.  My sister uses it a lot in her daycare business.  You can make it more saucy (less of a spread and more of sauce) and add a bit of hot sauce of you choice and you've got a pad thai peanut sauce.  You can add to smoothies. Oatmeal... the list goes on.  I've even added a bit of coconut as a spread. Awesome!  The peanut flavor is slight less strong as regular peanut butter. But I have also found that just a tiny pinch of sea salt develops a bit more flavor.  Honestly, if you love peanut butter. you are trying to eat more healthy food, you really should get just one jar and try it.  In the years since they first offered this peanut butter powder they have developed other flavors.. chocolate peanut butter powder.... cookie\/crackers... etc.  If you seach PB2, you can see what is available.

I purchased a different brand and they were too wide and not tall enough.  These are slightly taller - but less wide.  They work better for me.  It is a bit tricky to install them first.  Don't give up - pressing firmly.  Then, you should know that one size may work for one ear and another size the other.  I do have a bit of a problem keeping this in - but it's not the foam tip fault.  They keep them fairly short so they fit in the mini charger box.  I really need a longer foam tip to keep them in my ear.  I'm back to using my corded ear phones most of the time - it's a real shame because these would be so convenient in size.  Of all the foam tips, these were the best - they are not quite long enough to help me.

I( travel a lot so I end up needed a variety of lengths depending on what I'm doing at the moment.  These are great and travel with me in my &#34; cord organizer&#34; pouch. (If you travel, or just like to be tidy - I highly recommend the organizer pouches).  The fabric wrapped cords generally seem to last longer and stand up to coiling and uncoiling in my personal opinion.  I would definitely buy these again if I needed them.","parent_asin":"B0746LYM4T","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":1,"category":"Electronics","product_title":"AYIPE Micro USB Cable [3-Pack] - 3+6+10FT (1+2+3 Meter) - Blackwhite - Nylon Braide-Tangle-Free Micro USB Cable for Android, Samsung, HTC, Motorola, Nokia and More"}
{"rating":5,"title":"hard shell travel case for hair tools","text":"Got this to &#34;house&#34; a small roller type stick and flat iron.. a couple of rat tail combs and a small can of hairspray for my Mom's short hair.

It's lined with a soft, fuzzy material - an elastic band on side keeps your tools in place and the other side has a handy mesh flap perfect for combs, etc. I great zipper keeps everything where it needs to be and then... a super handy handle.

{"rating":5,"title":"Escort PASSPORT S55 Radar Detector","text":"First, I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews...I purchased this detector for my sedan.  It is pretty large compared to my other detectors, but not terribly so.  I have provided some pics with a ruler so you can consider.  It came with an &#34;accessory&#34; kit... but honestly, it doesn't really need it as it comes with the cord and suction cup windshield attachment. It doesn't come with a lot of instructions, but it's pretty easy to figure out how settings work. I do find it nice to have a spare cord (in the accessory kit) - they don't last forever.  The cord comes with an easily reachable &#34;mute&#34; button.  Nice if your windshield is deep and therefore more inconvenient to reach.  Although, I usually keep my detectors on &#34;auto mute&#34; so after a few beeps it stops.It has a phone jack connector (see pic) which is different for me - but doesn't seem to effect it's use.  One of the nicest things I can say so far about this detector is that the screen is BRIGHT and inset.  So it is VERY easy to read when it's silent.  An important feature to me.  It also came with a lovely case.  I included a pic of the outside with measurements and an inside view of the case.  The suction cup windshield attachment has a very easy to use &#34;release&#34; button so you can leave the suction cups just were they need to be, collect the detector, place in it's case and take it with you.  In Arizona it gets super hot.  So even though I have a carport, I take my detector inside or with me 99% of the time if I will be longer than 30 minutes.  So far, it seems to do what a radar detector is meant to do, reminding me to take my foot off the gas pedal. It is also good to note that if you are hit with a laser, it's too late before you hear the alarm.  I never hesitate to update my reviews if updated info would be helpful. And just a reminder, I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.","parent_asin":"B016AR5A7O","helpful_vote":47,"verified_purchase":1,"category":"Electronics","product_title":"Escort Passport S55 Radar\/Laser Detector with Accessories Combo Bundle (Blue)"}

{"rating":5,"title":"a good option","text":"I really like these...  the flat wires DO help them not to tangle... Has a &#34;universal&#34; tip as most things do this day and age... worked with my brand new LG G4 cell, my old rotary dial IPOD and my Kindle 8&#34; HDX.  It comes with 4 (2 sets) of extra ear cushions.  I feel that I have smallerish ears and I have a hard time finding earpods that are comfortable and will stay in.  These work great.  Comfortable and they have stayed in.  Mind you, I am NOT jogging with them in.  I only wish they'd come with a zipper case to hold them in for convenience.  At the price point, you'd think they would.  It does also have a microphone and I have &#34;tested&#34; that... worked. It has a little attachable pinch clip to keep in place as you move around. The foam tips are sort of like memory foam, but almost a bit softer really.  I think this both helps them stay in AND retain comfort.  The sound is very clean and clear - for an adult anyway.  The tips are cornflower blue if that matters to anyone... I think the pic is very clear and representative. I will update if there are any issues.<br \/>UPDATE: 6\/29\/2015 I have used these earbuds a number of times... one of the issues I have had in the past is that this &#34;shape&#34; of earbud doesn't want to stay in my ear... (tiny ears?) but these DO stay in.. I think it's the type of foam tip... seems to grip a bit better? To be fair, again, I am not jogging with them in... I am mostly in a sitting position using them. The &#34;flat&#34; wires really do help them not get all tangled... having stay that.. they also resist &#34;wrapping&#34; a bit too.  This is probably good. Otherwise you'd break the wires inside. The kiss of death to any wired accessory. Also, I've been informed that these are going to start coming with carry cases!!  Yup.  That would make them 5 star in my humble opinion and I'm keeping them in my &#34;save&#34; pile for a possible second order.<br \/>UPDATE 7\/26\/2015... Still happy with my purchase.  I am informed by the seller that they are now including a case.  This makes it definitely a 5-star value and worthy of a purchase.
