I had some really ugly black cable cords just sitting along the floor.  Ugly to say the least.  So, I thought I would try these.  I just installed this along my base board (looks like quarter round) and it PERFECTLY holds and hides the cords.  I have two cable lines and a very small, flat land line cord in it... plenty of room for another cable if necessary.  There are no instructions.. but it's pretty easy.  There is a clear film on the outside/front - the back is a the self stick.  I was placing it on a painted, non textured wall - so it's very flat and the perfect material for this use.  A couple of things I learned as I was placing it... it worked best for me to cord up the holder before sticking to the wall - IMPORTANT - the sticky back is SOLID - NO repositioning at all. You want to make sure you have shoved up against the last one you placed as tightly as possible - you will still see the seam between each length - but less so if you carefully, firmly place each piece. Before removing the sticky back I \"placed\" it in position to see if I liked it and it would work.  Good thing, because once you remove the sticky back, it is NOT coming off without the sheet rock in torn pieces... just fyi.  I chose to position the opening part of the D tube facing up to make it easier to put another cord in or take one out... personal choice.  The ad says it is paintable and that is what I will try next.  Having said that, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful - and I am eager to see if this will stand the test of time and use.. meaning.. cords pulled, etc.  I see no reason why you couldn't use this going up a wall (thinking of TV that has been hung on wall, etc - personal taste - but remember, the sticky tape is solid and won't be removed without tearing/damaging paint.  As for textured surfaces - like wall texture, I am thinking that as positive as this sticky tape is, as long as it's not too textured, it should work - but to be honest, I have not tried it on a textured surface.  As with most things that use a form of sticky tape, the smoother the surface, the better it will stick.)

Of course the dots are more reasonably priced, however, the speaker ability is really where it's vastly different.  Obviously the tower is much better in the speaker department.  However, I did find that there is a cordless speaker you can buy to go with your 2nd gen dot that is an improvement and still at lower price point than the tower when combined with the cost of the dot. (Mokcao cordless speaker - amazon sells it too) Because the dots are so reasonably priced we have them in all 3 major rooms and use the cordless speaker to drop one dot in and take it outside to our sunroom when we like.  Over all, I am pleased with both my tower AND dots... but probably will stick to dot purchases in the future because of the price point.  I would say if you've been on the fence, the dot is well worth a try.  It's very easy to set up, you will need to download the app, also easy to follow step by step setups.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Escort PASSPORT S55 Radar Detector", "text": "First, I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews...I purchased this detector for my sedan.  It is pretty large compared to my other detectors, but not terribly so.  I have provided some pics with a ruler so you can consider.  It came with an &#34;accessory&#34; kit... but honestly, it doesn't really need it as it comes with the cord and suction cup windshield attachment. It doesn't come with a lot of instructions, but it's pretty easy to figure out how settings work. I do find it nice to have a spare cord (in the accessory kit) - they don't last forever.  The cord comes with an easily reachable &#34;mute&#34; button.  Nice if your windshield is deep and therefore more inconvenient to reach.  Although, I usually keep my detectors on &#34;auto mute&#34; so after a few beeps it stops.It has a phone jack connector (see pic) which is different for me - but doesn't seem to effect it's use.  One of the nicest things I can say so far about this detector is that the screen is BRIGHT and inset.  So it is VERY easy to read when it's silent.  An important feature to me.  It also came with a lovely case.  I included a pic of the outside with measurements and an inside view of the case.  The suction cup windshield attachment has a very easy to use &#34;release&#34; button so you can leave the suction cups just were they need to be, collect the detector, place in it's case and take it with you.  In Arizona it gets super hot.  So even though I have a carport, I take my detector inside or with me 99% of the time if I will be longer than 30 minutes.  So far, it seems to do what a radar detector is meant to do, reminding me to take my foot off the gas pedal. It is also good to note that if you are hit with a laser, it's too late before you hear the alarm.  I never hesitate to update my reviews if updated info would be helpful.

{"rating": 5, "title": "a good option", "text": "I really like these...  the flat wires DO help them not to tangle... Has a &#34;universal&#34; tip as most things do this day and age... worked with my brand new LG G4 cell, my old rotary dial IPOD and my Kindle 8&#34; HDX.  It comes with 4 (2 sets) of extra ear cushions.  I feel that I have smallerish ears and I have a hard time finding earpods that are comfortable and will stay in.  These work great.  Comfortable and they have stayed in.  Mind you, I am NOT jogging with them in.  I only wish they'd come with a zipper case to hold them in for convenience.  At the price point, you'd think they would.  It does also have a microphone and I have &#34;tested&#34; that... worked. It has a little attachable pinch clip to keep in place as you move around. The foam tips are sort of like memory foam, but almost a bit softer really.  I think this both helps them stay in AND retain comfort.  The sound is very clean and clear - for an adult anyway.  The tips are cornflower blue if that matters to anyone... I think the pic is very clear and representative. I will update if there are any issues.<br />UPDATE: 6/29/2015 I have used these earbuds a number of times... one of the issues I have had in the past is that this &#34;shape&#34; of earbud doesn't want to stay in my ear... (tiny ears?) but these DO stay in.. I think it's the type of foam tip... seems to grip a bit better? To be fair, again, I am not jogging with them in... I am mostly in a sitting position using them. The &#34;flat&#34; wires really do help them not get all tangled... having stay that.. they also resist &#34;wrapping&#34; a bit too.  This is probably good. Otherwise you'd break the wires inside.

I purchased a 6pk for one of his Christmas gifts.  He LOVED them.  They are larger than the Asian canned oysters - and as others have reported, there are some pieces and whole oysters - between the size of a quarter and 50cent piece - instead of the nickel sized of others.  He says they taste better than others, the texture is better and just over all better across the board.  Cost?  Yes, they are expensive.  But - quality and made in the USA is just better across the board for many reasons.  So - I'm gonna buy them again.  They have several flavors and even mussels.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Iconic Caffe Latte", "text": "I am having some major surgery coming up.  My doctor recommended a different drink (3 a day for 5 days before surgery - and 3 a day for 2 weeks after). Only problem is the protein drink he recommended was HORRIBLE.  The 5th ingredient is anchovy paste!!  It was truly awful and a hundred bucks for 12 drinks!  So, I asked if I could sub out the awful, super expensive drink for these Iconic drinks.  He agreed!  I ordered the Iconic chocolate truffle, the caffe latte and the vanilla.  Do you like chocolate milk?! Who doesn't, the chocolate truffle tastes like the best chocolate milk you've ever tried!  When I drink the caffe latte I pour it over ice or blend with ice and it's like a really terrific iced coffee!  The vanilla bean is as delicious as it sounds. And they all SMELL good too. Honestly.  All of this, without anything that is bad for you and 20 grams of protein!!  In fact my doctor says he will now recommend these drinks.  When you HAVE to do a meal replacement drink - you have GOT to try these first!  I am soooo grateful for them - for taste and cost!  Plus they are shelf stable!!!  So refrigerate as you need them!

{"rating": 5, "title": "quick and easy", "text": "I purchased this for my god daughter who is a nutritionist.  I have become aware of the studies on naturally occuring arsenic in rice.  It was a theory that processed rice, like Minute Rice might have less of this naturally occuring arsenic as it has been &#34;hulled&#34; thoroughly in order for a quicker cooking process.  But... that's only what I took from reading about these studies.  These studies also noted that brown rice contains more naturally occuring arsenic because the hull remains.  The hull does provide a slight more &#34;fiber&#34; but I don't think it is enough to make me eat it.  They noted that white rice still contains this arsenic, but a lower lever due to removal of the hull.  Still in all they recommend rinsing all rice until the rinse water is clear... but not so with Minute Rice... apparently that is less necessary. But I suspect it would also alter the cooking of Minute Rice to rinse it. Also noted was that Adults should eat no more than 1 cup per week of rice.  Yikes.  I know my god daughter eats quite a lot of rice... as does my niece. So I was hoping SOME of their rice might be Minute Rice.

Please remember that we all have the right to have an opinion and I am not trying to make any one change their minds or believe the way I do.<br />First, the movie is very one sided.  Having said that, it is important to see what is happening and even the one sided approach can spark conversations that will lead to much needed changes.<br />Second, Sea World had an opportunity to comment.  They declined.  That speaks volumes to me and leads me to believe they may have been less than honest. I would have liked to have heard their &#34;side.&#34;<br />That being said, you cannot completely discount the accounts of the persons who were actually involved with these particular animals.<br />I believe it is a sincere and horrible tragedy that these animals have been captured at all, ever.<br />I think this movie is worth a viewing and a conversation.  I gave it 5 stars for the POSSIBILITY that it could have a positive impact on how we see this magnficent animals.  Orcas, also known as &#34;killer whales&#34; are actually dolphins.  And to date, there has never been a recorded &#34;attack&#34; on humans in the wild.  I think this important to note. In fact, the just the opposite as with smaller species of dolphins. And they have unique &#34;personalities&#34;... not unlike humans. I am fortunate enough to live in Oregon and not far from where we hosted Keiko (Free Willy) for some time as they attempted to &#34;rehabilitate&#34; Keiko enough to release him.  Sadly, that ended tragically. And in Keiko's case, I wish they had never released him.  Clearly he was very deeply imprinted on humans and sought out gentle contact with them even after his release. I believe that while Tilikum and Keiko were both orcas, they are were clearly different in temperament. I don't think you can discount temperament either.  Sadly Tilikum has proven that he has the capcity to harm and the willingness to do so. Further,  I was shocked to hear that the &#34;trainers&#34; at Sea World are NOT trained or educated at all.  You can walk off the street and apply to be a &#34;trainer.&#34;  If you can swim, have an appealing personality and physical appearance, you're in.  No real education, no real training, not even a high school diploma.  Disappointing.  However, to me that puts more of the burden of responsibility squarely on Sea World for the safety of their &#34;trainers.&#34;<br />I hope that if you chose to watch this movie that you do so with an open mind and heart.

I added some pics too.  The mesh bag helps to protect the shock pack AND the sharp edges of the shock pack from coming in contact with skin.  Win/win.  Just a hint on the bags:  I slid the shock packs into the mesh bags before I filled them just to make it super easy - worked like a dream.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Do it", "text": "Ok.  I am not a total neat freak, but I do LOVE this thing.  I have looked at these for years and after packing for my last trip, I finally just fell off and bought it.  It works just as advertised and another reviewer, &#34;top 500 reviewer&#34; did a very useful video with her review.  I didn't get my folder for free, but I am still going to sing it's praises.  It really does save space to have everything folded in the same way. I travel a lot and I am using it to pack and of course when doing laundry.  After a try or two, I got into a rhythm and it was a dream.  Just remember to place shirts face down first and center them... and then fold up the bottom if they are longer than the folder. Perfect every time.  Pants are good too, just remember that they need to be the width of the bottom, center folder. Also, folding on a surface that is a good height for you is key.  I have bed that is up on feet about 4&#34; taller and so it hits me about mid thigh.  Plus it's a queen size bed.  I just pile my folding on one side and begin. My bed has the right amount of space and is the right height for me, not too much bending and you can easily see what you've got.  I have found that it works best with cotton items... chiffon, floaty, poly- you know, slippery stuff is a bit tricky and takes a bit of practice, but I've even mastered that.  My husband is a husky dude - 4x.  This folds big guy tshirts and others easily. Using the same principles you will learn from practice with regular size stuff, it's truly a breeze and LOVE how all of his shirts are all folded the same way now. Saves space and is neat and tidy without any more effort than normal manual folding.  Haven't tried the towel fold yet, but I will.  Give me time.  I'm still jumping up and down about all the clothing I can fold now! I am admiring the neat and tidy stack of clothing for my next trip as I write this.  Now, being honest, I am going to report that the &#34;hinge&#34; parts are most likely going to give out after a period of use... but as another reviewer noted, gorilla tape will correct this when it occurs. I have some of that stuff.  I will do that because frankly I will never give this thing up.  Other than what I have reported, I don't think I can add anything else.  I will, as I always do, update if there are any issues to report.  I really, honestly love this thing.
